        <h1>GPT-2, two ways</h1>
        <p className="activity-deck">One small base model, two ways. First on its own: it continues whatever you type. Then with a page of invented conversations between a &ldquo;Human&rdquo; and an &ldquo;Assistant&rdquo; in front of your question, the move Anthropic&rsquo;s researchers made in 2021. Same weights, different document.</p>
        <p className="activity-note">Both run on your own computer. GPT-2 is about 130 MB the first time, then cached. It is small and strange: watch the <em>form</em> of the reply, not whether it is right.</p>

            <h2>The raw model</h2>
            <p>Load GPT-2 and give it a question, a line of a poem, or the start of a recipe. It doesn&rsquo;t answer. It guesses what kind of document it is in and keeps writing.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ask it &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; a few times. Does the same question get the same kind of reply?</li>
              <li>Try the start of a list, a script, or &ldquo;Q: … A:&rdquo;. What does the shape of your text make it do?</li>
              <li>Under the output: the five likeliest next tokens, with their odds.</li>

            <p>Now the question goes in twice. Column 1 is the raw model again. Column 2 puts your question after the HHH prompt: a paragraph describing a &ldquo;helpful, polite, honest&rdquo; assistant and fourteen made-up conversations, written by two of the paper&rsquo;s authors. Your question becomes the next &ldquo;Human:&rdquo; line, and the program stops GPT-2 when it starts to write the human&rsquo;s next line.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Open &ldquo;Read the script&rdquo; first. That is the whole trick.</li>
              <li>Compare the two columns. Which one sounds like it is talking <em>to you</em>? Which one stops?</li>
              <li>GPT-2 can only fit the last few conversations; open &ldquo;Everything GPT-2 read&rdquo; to see what was cut.</li>
