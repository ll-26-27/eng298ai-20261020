# Role Play with Large Language Models

**Shanahan, McDonell, and Reynolds's 2023 paper proposing that a dialogue agent is best described as playing a role, or many roles at once, rather than as a someone.**

## Why it matters here

It is the required reading for the October 20 workshop, and it gives the experiments their working vocabulary. The paper's problem is how to talk about a chatbot that sounds like a person without either believing it is one or pretending it isn't doing anything. Its answer is role play: the underlying model is "a non-deterministic simulator capable of role-playing an infinity of characters," and a given conversation draws one character (or a cloud of possible ones) out of it. That lets us say "it's lying" or "it says it's afraid" as descriptions of a character, while keeping open what, if anything, is behind it.

Two analogies from the paper are worth having to hand. In twenty questions, the agent never really commits to one object; it keeps every answer consistent with the questions so far "in superposition." And the agent is "more like a performer in improvisational theatre than an actor in a conventional, scripted play." Both describe what [GPT-2, two ways](/gpt-2) shows directly.

## In the readings

The course copy is an abstract and notes for the May 2023 preprint ([notes](https://github.com/ll-26-27/eng-298ai-context/blob/24df8b8/_context/LL-readings/papers-on-ai-md/2305.16367v1--role-play-with-large-language-models.md)); the syllabus cites the *Nature* version. From the arXiv preprint:

- "We can see a dialogue agent as role-playing a single character. Second, taking a more nuanced view, we can see a dialogue agent as a superposition of simulacra within a multiverse of possible characters (Janus, 2022)."
- The two cases it works through are "(apparent) deception and (apparent) self-awareness" (abstract).

Its debt to janus's ["Simulators"](simulators.md) is explicit. Compare Wilde's "Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth" in ["The Critic as Artist"](the-critic-as-artist.md), and Lord Henry's "an actor of a part that has not been written for him" in [*Dorian Gray*](the-picture-of-dorian-gray.md).
