# LaMDA: Language Models for Dialog Applications (2022)

**Google's 2022 paper on LaMDA, a model trained for open-ended conversation and scored on sensibleness, safety, and groundedness; the model Blake Lemoine came to believe was sentient.**

## Why it matters here

LaMDA was built for conversation, and the paper shows what that meant in practice: up to 137 billion parameters, pretrained on "1.56T words of public dialog data and web text," then fine-tuned with crowdworker labels to filter unsafe replies and taught to consult a search tool, a translator, and a calculator so its answers were "grounded in known sources, rather than responses that merely sound plausible." It even tested role consistency, with the model playing Mount Everest and a music recommender. Google had announced it at I/O in May 2021. Five months after the paper, the transcript an engineer released made LaMDA the center of the first public argument over chatbot sentience.
