# Transformers.js

**Hugging Face's JavaScript library for running models in the browser or Node, the engine under the in-browser experiments.**

## In plain terms

Transformers.js runs ONNX models in JavaScript, on the CPU through WebAssembly or on the GPU through [WebGPU](webgpu.md). A page names a model, the library downloads its files once (the browser caches them), and generation runs on the visitor's own machine: no server, no key, no account. The experiments use version 4 (`@huggingface/transformers`), inside a Web Worker so the page stays responsive.

Running locally makes the base model something students can poke at directly, at the cost of only small models being practical.
