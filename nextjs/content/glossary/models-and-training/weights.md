# Weights

**The learned numbers that make a model what it is; the file you download when you download a model.**

## In plain terms

The architecture is the recipe; the weights are the cooked dish. Two models with the same architecture and different weights behave completely differently: SmolLM2-135M and SmolLM2-135M-Instruct have the same shape and differ only in their weights, which is why one spirals and the other answers.

A "checkpoint" is the weights saved at some point in training. When a company releases a model's weights, anyone can run it; when it doesn't, you can only reach it through the company's service (see [open weights](open-weights.md)).
