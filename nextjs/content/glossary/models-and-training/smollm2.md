# SmolLM2

**A family of small open-weights models from Hugging Face (2024), each released as a base model and an instruct version; the 135M pair carries the four columns.**

## In plain terms

SmolLM2 comes in three sizes (135M, 360M, and 1.7B parameters), and each size comes in a base and an instruct version. That makes it a matched pair: the same tokenizer, the same pretraining, differing only in post-training. The four columns use the 135M pair so the difference between columns 1 and 3 is post-training and nothing else.

Because it was pretrained in 2024 on text that already contained many chatbot conversations, the base model can sound assistant-like on its own, which is itself something to notice beside GPT-2.
