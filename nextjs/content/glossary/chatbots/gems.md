# Gems

**Custom versions of Google's Gemini, made by writing instructions, naming the result, and adding knowledge files; previewed at I/O in May 2024, released 28 August 2024, and being migrated to Gemini skills from 17 November 2026.**

## In plain terms

A Gem is Gemini with a standing set of instructions. Google's launch post put it in one line: "Simply write instructions for your Gem, give it a name, and then chat with it whenever you want." The editor in the screenshot has three fields (name, description, instructions) and a preview pane; the instructions here are the same ones given to the custom GPT and the Claude project in the layers experiment: "You are a teaching fellow for GENED 1000. Answer only from the uploaded syllabus and assignment sheets…" Further down the page are a default tool and a Knowledge section for files ([screenshot 20](../../history/_images/20-gemini-gem-editor-knowledge.png)).

Google announced Gems at I/O on 14 May 2024 ("customized versions of Gemini"), released them to paying Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users on 28 August 2024 with a set of premade Gems, and later opened them to free users (verify the date). In October 2026 the Gems page carries a banner: "Gems will become skills starting Nov 17, 2026 … we'll automatically begin migrating your Gems to skills" ([screenshot 17](../../history/_images/17-gemini-gems-gallery-with-skills-banner.png)).

## Where it fits

**Configuration.** Gems are Google's version of the configuration layer that OpenAI opened with custom GPTs in November 2023: a persona and a job written in plain language, laid over the same model. Their planned conversion into skills, reusable instructions the model can call when relevant, is one sign of the shift from configured chatbots to agents that load instructions as needed.
