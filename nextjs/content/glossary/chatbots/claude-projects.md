# Claude Projects

**Workspaces in Anthropic's Claude.ai, launched 25 June 2024, that give a set of chats shared custom instructions and a shared store of uploaded knowledge.**

![A chat inside the "Course TF Assistant" project: Claude reports it has no syllabus yet and declines to give the answer to a graded problem](../../history/_images/16-claude-chat-inside-project.png)

## In plain terms

A project is a folder with two things attached: instructions that apply to every chat in it, and "project knowledge," files and text that Claude can draw on. At launch Anthropic said each project "includes a 200K context window, the equivalent of a 500-page book," and offered the feature to Pro and Team subscribers, with Team users able to share chats to a project feed.

In the screenshot, the project's instructions say to answer only from the syllabus and never to give away graded answers. Asked for a due date and the answer to question 2, Claude looks for files, finds none, tells the student to email the course staff, and declines to give the answer. It also adds a note to the builder that the project has no documents yet. The instructions dialog and the knowledge menu are in [screenshot 14](../../history/_images/14-claude-project-instructions-dialog.png) and [screenshot 15](../../history/_images/15-claude-project-knowledge-add-context-menu.png).

## Where it fits

**Configuration.** Projects are Anthropic's answer to custom GPTs (November 2023), arriving between them and Google's Gems (August 2024): the persona and the reference material are written once and laid over every conversation. Unlike a GPT, a project was built for its owner and team rather than for a public store.

## Try it

[How to build a bot](/build-a-bot) shows the same Course TF Assistant as a custom GPT, a Claude project, and a Gem.
