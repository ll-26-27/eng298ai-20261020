# System prompt

**Instructions supplied in a system role to guide the assistant’s behavior.**

## In plain terms

For the Course TF Assistant, an invented instruction might say: “Ask for the passage before interpreting it.” The system prompt supplies context for generation; editing it is not a training run. Distinguish the role carrying an instruction from the instruction’s wording, and inspect what the application sends.

## In the readings

Askell et al. investigate prompting alongside other ways of shaping an assistant (abstract). Plato, *Phaedrus*, 271a–272b, gives a different standard for responsive speech: attending to the particular hearer. A prompt requesting that behavior is a design attempt, not proof that the standard has been met.

## Try it

[GPT-2, two ways](/gpt-2): the same question with and without the first assistant script in front of it.
