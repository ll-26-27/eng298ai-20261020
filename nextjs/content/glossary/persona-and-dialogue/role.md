# Role

**A label identifying a message’s place in a chat exchange.**

## In plain terms

In these experiments, user, assistant, and system identify different kinds of messages. These labels organize the app’s input (some APIs carry system instructions in a separate field); a medieval monk is instead a character the assistant may be asked to perform. Inspect both levels: which message carries an instruction, and which speaking part the instruction asks for.

## In the readings

Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson, §3.2–3.3, describe current and next speakers as positions in an unfolding exchange. That provides a comparison, not an equivalence: a human conversation’s changing speakership is different from a chat application’s fixed message labels.
