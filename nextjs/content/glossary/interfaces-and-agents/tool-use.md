# Tool use

**Letting a model request an operation that software can carry out.**

## In plain terms

Tools extend an assistant beyond producing text: a host can execute a requested file read, search, or calculation and return the result. The model’s request and the software’s execution are separate steps.

In mini-claw, follow the single file tool from its description to the request to the returned result. In Claude Code, use a file-reading task as the same running example.
