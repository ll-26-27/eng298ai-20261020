# Tool call

**One specific request to run a tool with particular inputs.**

## In plain terms

A call is an event, not just an available capability. Tool calling supports structured inputs; whether a call executes depends on the host and its checks.

In an invented mini-claw trace, distinguish “read_note exists” from “read_note was requested with path memory.md.” The second gives you something concrete to inspect.
