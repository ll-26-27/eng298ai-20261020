# Conversation history

**The record of earlier messages in an exchange.**

## In plain terms

Claude Code includes conversation history in its working context. Saving a transcript does not mean every line will remain in every later model call: the available context is limited, and older material can be summarized.

In the Course TF Assistant example, compare asking a follow-up in the same conversation with starting a new one. Which earlier details are supplied this time?
