# Agent

**A system that lets a model choose steps and use tools toward a task.**

## In plain terms

Anthropic distinguishes agents, which direct their own process, from workflows with predetermined paths. Usage varies, so ask what choices a particular system delegates to the model.

“Explain this bug” can end with prose. “Find and fix this bug” might require Claude Code to inspect files, edit, and check the result. Mini-claw isolates that structure in a small implemented loop.
