# Sandbox

**An enforced boundary around what a running process can access.**

## In plain terms

Claude Code’s sandboxing can constrain filesystem and network access. This differs from asking the model to avoid certain actions: the boundary is implemented by the execution environment.

Mini-claw exposes no shell or network tool. Its file tool permits Markdown writes only under notes/ and one-line appends to memory.md; tests cover path traversal, symlink escapes, and permission refusals. These checks constrain this tool, rather than sandboxing the entire server process.
