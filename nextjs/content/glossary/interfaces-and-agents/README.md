# Interfaces and agents

What gets wrapped around a model: the screen, saved context, reference files, tools, and the software that lets an agent act. Read the table from a chat window outward to an agent with its own computer. The Course TF Assistant and Claude Code in a student’s repository are recurring examples; invented scenarios are labeled. Product profiles belong in [Chatbots](../chatbots/README.md), while [Persona and dialogue](../persona-and-dialogue/README.md) covers roles, system prompts, and conversational interpretation.

[How to build a bot](/build-a-bot) shows the configuration layer (instructions, knowledge, tools) in ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude; the timeline's [agents chapter](/timeline#agents) describes the loop, the memory file, and the harness. Retrieval, MCP, subagents, hooks, and computer use explain the larger systems around them. Sources were checked on 2026-10-19. Screenshot captions identify interface evidence; unconfirmed product promises remain marked “(verify).”
