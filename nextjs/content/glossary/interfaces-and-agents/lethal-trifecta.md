# The lethal trifecta

**Simon Willison’s name for combining private data access, untrusted content, and external communication.**

## In plain terms

The dangerous combination permits a prompt injection encountered in outside material to steer disclosure of private information. The term identifies a configuration of capabilities, not a claim that every run will leak data.

Writing a local note and transmitting it outside the workspace are different powers. Mini-claw’s file tool has no external-communication operation, removing that direct transmission route. Its Claude engine still calls an external model provider; the whole application is not offline.
