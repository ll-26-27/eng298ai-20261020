# Permissions

**Enforced rules about which actions an agent may execute.**

## In plain terms

Claude Code’s permission system governs tool execution; written instructions influence what the model requests. A request can therefore be well formed and still be refused.

A student might authorize reading an essay while withholding permission to publish it. Look for that boundary in the host’s checks, rather than expecting a polite sentence in CLAUDE.md to enforce it.
