# Function calling

**Expressing a tool request as a named operation with structured arguments.**

## In plain terms

A tool definition tells the model what operation exists and which inputs it accepts. The surrounding application handles execution. This makes a request easier for software to interpret than a sentence saying “please read that file.”

For an invented read_note tool, the arguments might be {"path":"memory.md"}. Check the requested path before treating the call as authorized.
