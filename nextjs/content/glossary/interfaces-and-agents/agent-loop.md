# Agent loop

**The repeated cycle of model call, tool request, execution, and returned result.**

## In plain terms

Claude Code describes its work as gathering context, taking action, and verifying results. Repetition allows a tool result to change what happens next.

Mini-claw exposes each iteration in its trace. If a requested note is missing, does the next step acknowledge the error, choose another action, or stop? Read the sequence rather than judging only the final answer.
