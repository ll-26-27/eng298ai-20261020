# Context assembly

**Selecting and arranging what the model receives for a particular step.**

## In plain terms

Context engineering involves managing instructions, messages, tool descriptions, and retrieved information within limited space. A file elsewhere on disk is useful only if the system brings relevant information into the model’s input.

For a student using Claude Code, ask: did the agent read the assignment file, or merely see its name? Mini-claw’s trace is a way to make that question inspectable.
